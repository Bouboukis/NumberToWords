**Number to Words coding exercise 23**

Complicated exercise to print the digits of a given number.

For the current exercise we had to count the digits, 
reverse the digits and then use a method to print the last digit.
Finally, if the original number finishes with 0, we had to add the zeros at the printout. 

In the future will be much easier by using arrays.
